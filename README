Introduction

FamilyMap is an Android application that provides a geographical view into your family history.
One of the most exciting aspects of researching family history is discovering your origins.
FamilyMap provides a detailed view into where you came from. 


FamilyMap: A Quick Overview

The FamilyMap Android application consists of six main views:
  Main Activity (Login and Top-level map)
  Map Activity (Lower-level maps)
  Person Activity
  Settings Activity
  Filter Activity
  Search Activity
The FamilyMap Application uses two third party services:
  FamilyMap Service - Used for user management and requesting data (See FamilyMap Service under Resources for more information)
  Google Maps v2 for Android - Used for displaying maps


The AndroidManifest.xml file is missing due to the sensitive api keys contained in it.
